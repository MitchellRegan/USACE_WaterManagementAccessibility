        <!-- Something really funky is going on. First, the API used directly on the USACE website is blocked by CORS, yay. That means we can't use it on the website.<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-decoration:line-through">
            I found a slightly better wiki on the CWMS-radar-api repo. It links to that Swagger-UI we were looking at (the API doc webpage).<br>
        The issue is, the docs has completely vanished. It is completely inaccessible and 404s. YAYYYYY<br>
        <br>
        So pretty much, that leaves us with ths USGS api because it appears to be the only reliable API at the moment.<br>
        That then just leaves us with the issue that we have no idea which sites are USACE and which arent. YAAAAAYAYAYYAYAYAY<br></div>
        <br>
        Scratch all of that, it is back up. Maybe it was the network, maybe it was down, I don't know. But it's back now.<br>
        It does seem to be rather slow tho... ðŸ˜”<br>
        <br> -->
        So here's the thing, it is painfully slow. It still kinda works tho. Try <b>JPLT2, SWF, 24</b>. Then just wait, it is painful.
